The **L4G Payment Portal** is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to simplify payment processing and course completion verification. Users can input their name, email, and contact information through an intuitive interface. The application first retrieves the user's email associated with course completion from the database via a GET request to an API. Once the email is fetched, a POST request is made to generate a unique Razorpay payment link. The generated payment link is then sent to the user's email and phone via SMS, notifying them about the payment. With real-time notifications, error handling, and seamless integration, the portal offers a smooth and efficient experience for payment processing and course completion verification.
